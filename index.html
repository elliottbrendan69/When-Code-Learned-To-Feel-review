    <article class="content">
      <p>I’ll be honest — I’m not the kind of person who sits around wondering how songs get made. Same way I don’t ask my favorite Riverwest diner what’s in their cheesecake that tastes like heartbreak and vanilla extract. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p>

      <p>But when a pre-release of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> landed in my inbox, that rule kind of broke itself. The blurb called it <em>“no pulse, all heart”</em> — which sounded like marketing bravado. Then I hit play, and damn it, they weren’t wrong. The thing sounded too sharp, too alive — like it shouldn’t exist. So I did the journalist thing: opened too many tabs, sharpened my skepticism, and tried to figure out how something this weirdly human came out of a machine.</p>

      <p>Unless you’ve been living in a bubble, you already know AI’s moved from headlines to playlists. The music industry loves to warn that it’ll kill creativity — maybe that day’s coming, but BAYSGATE clearly didn’t get the memo. And if I’m honest, I think they get a pass.</p>

      <p>They already had everything written: lyrics, melodies, production — the bones and the blood. But no voice. So they did what any 2025 romantic would do — opened a laptop and invited AI vocalists to take a seat at the mic.</p>

      <p>Yeah. All of them were artificial. And somehow, the result still feels heartbreakingly real.</p>

      <p><strong>The vocals are smart — not because they’re perfect, but because they sound like they’re in on the secret.</strong> There’s a digital smirk hiding in every take, and the lyrics do the rest — sharp, self-aware, and unmistakably human.</p>

      <p>Twice I laughed out loud. Twice I felt personally attacked. And somewhere in there, I started saving genres I normally skip.</p>

      <p>That’s the real trick of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em>: it’s not trying to impress you — it’s trying to understand you.</p>

      <p>The record kicks off with <em>Shoes</em>, a 90s-alt pop hit that could’ve been written by American Hi-Fi’s younger cousin. <em>Bad Girls Never Sleep</em> drifts through a neon bassline like a Miley Cyrus video that got arrested for public indecency. <em>Running When Parked</em> bites with late-’80s edge; <em>Glitch</em> just sits in your Wi-Fi like a ghost humming to itself.</p>

      <p>Then BAYSGATE lean soft. <em>The Backup Princess</em> is one of two Disney heartbreaks — this one with union dues — while <em>Lollipop</em> spins early-’60s bubblegum into an existential sugar rush, and <em>Text STOP STACY</em> nails modern romance with the precision of a passive-aggressive screenshot. <em>Aurora Gory Alice</em> builds a doomed space opera out of prog-rock fragments, and <em>404: I Don’t Update Anymore</em> leaves a dumped AI stranded in digital purgatory.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, <em>Good Luck With That</em> detonates into a funk breakdown that sounds like Bruno Mars crashed a Stevie Wonder session, while <em>All About Her</em> glows with genuine K-pop shimmer — partly in Japanese — before gliding into the hushed confessions of <em>Two Voices in the Kitchen</em> and the cinematic ache of <em>Spillways</em> and <em>You Would Have Liked Her</em>.</p>

      <p>Every pivot feels deliberate, like someone mapping emotion rather than chasing playlists.</p>

      <p>And then there’s <em>Better Off as Zombies</em> — a funky little jazz-pop side-eye at modern life, so self-aware it hurts. It’ll date faster than an iPhone, but somehow still makes doomscrolling sound romantic.</p>

      <p><em>Dying for Twenty</em> closes it all — quiet, merciless, and as haunting as anything you’ll ever hear.</p>

      <p><em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> doesn’t flex. It doesn’t apologize. It just listens — and that’s somehow the most human thing of all. In an era where algorithms reward sameness, BAYSGATE built something messy and alive: a cathedral of contradictions.</p>

      <p><strong>Twenty-nine tracks is a lot.</strong><br>Then again, so are emotions.<br>And BAYSGATE make every one count.</p>
