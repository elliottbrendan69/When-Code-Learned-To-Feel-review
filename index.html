      <p style="font-size:13px;color:#a9b0b6;margin-top:6px;"><em>Album cover: When Code Learned to Feel by BAYSGATE</em></p>
    </div>

    <article class="content">
      <p>Iâ€™ll be honest â€” Iâ€™m not the kind of person who sits around wondering how songs get made. Same way I donâ€™t ask my favorite diner in Wisconsin whatâ€™s in their cheesecake that tastes like heartbreak and vanilla extract. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p>

      <p>But when a pre-release of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> landed in my inbox, I couldnâ€™t let it go. The thing sounded too sharp, too alive â€” like it shouldnâ€™t exist. So I did the journalist thing: opened too many tabs and tried to figure out how something this weirdly human came out of a machine.</p>

      <p>Turns out BAYSGATE had everything written: lyrics, melodies, production, the bones and the blood. But no voice. So they did what any 2025 romantic would do â€” opened a laptop and invited AI vocalists to take a seat at the mic.</p>

      <p>Yeah. All of them were artificial. And somehow, the result still feels heartbreakingly real.</p>

      <p>Unless youâ€™ve been living in a bubble, you already know AIâ€™s moved from headlines to playlists. The music industry loves to say AI will kill creativity â€” maybe that dayâ€™s coming, but BAYSGATE clearly didnâ€™t get the memo. What the machines added wasnâ€™t inspiration; it was interpretation. And the result doesnâ€™t sound robotic â€” it sounds intentional.</p>

      <p>The vocals are amazing â€” not because theyâ€™re flawless, but because they understand drama. Every hook lands like someone confessing something they didnâ€™t mean to say, and you can almost hear the digital equivalent of a smirk behind every performance. The words do the rest. BAYSGATE have this unnerving habit of turning emotion into math and somehow making it rhyme. Twice I laughed out loud. Twice I felt personally attacked. And somewhere in there, I started saving genres I normally skip.</p>

      <p>Thatâ€™s the real trick of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em>: itâ€™s not trying to impress you â€” itâ€™s trying to understand you.</p>

      <p>The record kicks off with <em>Shoes</em>, a 90s-alt pop hit that couldâ€™ve been written by American Hi-Fiâ€™s younger cousin. <em>Bad Girls Never Sleep</em> drifts through a neon bassline like a Miley Cyrus video that got arrested for public indecency. <em>Running When Parked</em> bites with late-â€™80s edge; <em>Glitch</em> just sits in your Wi-Fi like a ghost humming to itself.</p>

      <p>Then BAYSGATE lean soft. <em>The Backup Princess</em> is Disney heartbreak with union dues, while <em>Lollipop</em> spins early-â€™60s bubblegum into an existential sugar rush, and <em>Text STOP STACY</em> nails modern romance with the precision of a passive-aggressive screenshot. <em>Aurora Gory Alice</em> builds a doomed space opera out of prog-rock fragments, and <em>404: I Donâ€™t Update Anymore</em> leaves a dumped AI stranded in digital purgatory.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, <em>Good Luck With That</em> detonates into a funk breakdown that sounds like Bruno Mars crashed a Stevie Wonder session, while <em>All About Her</em> glows with genuine K-pop shimmer â€” partly in Japanese â€” before gliding into the hushed confessions of <em>Two Voices in the Kitchen</em> and the cinematic ache of <em>Spillways</em> and <em>You Would Have Liked Her</em>.</p>

      <p>Every pivot feels deliberate, like someone mapping emotion rather than chasing playlists.</p>

      <p><em>Dying for Twenty</em> closes it all â€” quiet, merciless, and as haunting as anything youâ€™ll ever hear.</p>

      <p><em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> doesnâ€™t flex. It doesnâ€™t apologize. It just listens â€” and thatâ€™s somehow the most human thing of all. In an era where algorithms reward sameness, BAYSGATE built something messy and alive: a cathedral of contradictions.</p>

      <p><strong>Twenty-nine tracks is a lot.</strong><br>Then again, so are emotions.<br>And BAYSGATE make every one count.</p>

      <p style="font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#d0d5da;">
        <strong>Skye Hartley</strong> didnâ€™t mean to become a music journalist â€” she just kept writing about songs until people started sending her promo links.
        Sheâ€™s a Milwaukee-based culture writer filing for <em>Static & Signal</em>, runs on caffeine and quiet awe, and maintains a complicated relationship with the replay button.
