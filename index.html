      <p>I’ll be honest — I’m not the kind of person who sits around wondering how songs get made. Same way I don’t ask my favorite diner in Wisconsin what’s in their cheesecake that tastes like heartbreak and vanilla extract. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p>

      <p>But when a pre-release of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> landed in my inbox, I couldn’t let it go. The thing sounded too sharp, too alive — like it shouldn’t exist. So I did the journalist thing: opened too many tabs and tried to figure out how something this weirdly human came out of a machine.</p>

      <p>Turns out BAYSGATE had everything written: lyrics, melodies, production, the bones and the blood. But no voice. So they did what any 2025 romantic would do — opened a laptop and invited AI vocalists to take a seat at the mic.</p>

      <p>Yeah. All of them were artificial. And somehow, the result still feels heartbreakingly real.</p>

BAYSGATE have this unnerving habit of turning emotion into math and somehow making it rhyme. Twice I laughed out loud. Twice I felt personally attacked. And somewhere in there, I started saving genres I normally skip.</p>

      <p>That’s the real trick of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em>: it’s not trying to impress you — it’s trying to understand you.</p>
